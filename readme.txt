Increase Your Site’s Revenue with the First Personalized Post-Purchase Upsell Tool 


We know just how hard you have to work to retain your existing customers and attracting new ones is no easy feat either. Statistics show that 60% of clients will make an initial purchase but won’t return to make another one. That’s why it’s so crucial you maximize your profit from every client when they have already made up their mind to buy something off your site. But how do you get them to buy more?

That’s where we come in. infinitycrowd helps online stores monetize their most important asset⁠—their customers. We help you increase your site’s revenue by offering a buying client special deals on items that are tailored specifically to their interests before they leave your site. 

Here’s how it works: 
We study your site and analyze your customer’s behavior patterns
A customer completes their purchase and pays. He or she is then sent to the “thank you” page on your site. 
Once the customer is on the “thank you” page, he or she is automatically offered the opportunity to buy another item that is tailored specifically to their interests. All the special deals appear in a coupon “on-sale” format. 
The customer can then click on the offer they are most interested in buying. Once the customer has chosen to accept the offer and purchase the item, the product is automatically added to his or her initial existing order in one click or through a fast checkout process. 

What Makes infinitycrowd the Best Upsell Solution? A Smart AI-Based Upsell Plugin That Automates Most of the Work for You!

Unlike other existing upsell plugin solutions where companies have to guess which offer will suit which customer and manually build complex condition processes for every type of customer, our AI-based solution will automatically determine which offers best suit your clients. 

We can tell which items will appeal to which clients based on a data point system that we’ve generated so that all you have to do is set up as many offers in the system and we will do the rest.

Real Personalization = Real Results 
We can all agree that every customer has different behavior patterns. That’s why we created infinitycrowd - a data point system that takes into account the customer’s buying patterns and all the data that was collected on a particular customer. For example, the products the customer has purchased or was interested in and browsed online, the “journey” he or she went through while browsing the site and whether it led them to buy an item or simply look into a specific category or product, etc. All of these can determine which offers would best suit that particular customer, ensuring we get a higher conversion rate that will only improve over time and will maximize the customer's buying process.

We Engage with Your Customers on Different Levels
We don’t settle for a mere “thank you” on the site’s “thank you for your purchase” page. When upselling your customers, our sophisticated system not only engages with them right after they’ve made a purchase but on additional channels, including email, their order page, home page and soon by text message. By doing so and presenting the customers with our variety of offers, we increase our chances of making an upsell. 

Don’t Lose Sales
Pre-purchase upsell can confuse your potential customer and make you lose a sale. On the other hand, our upsell offers are only presented to the customer after the completion of a purchase is made and paid for. This guarantees you won’t lose a sale, not even if your customer doesn’t end up making an upsell. 

Our System Works with Nearly All Payment Processors 
No matter which payment processor you work with, Infinitycrowd will be able to present upsell offers to your customers. The one-click upsell will only work, however, with a preferred payment processor (such as PayPal). Otherwise, the customer will have to go through a fast check-out process. In both cases, the added upsold item would be added to the original order.  

While Infinitycrowd’s default mode is to add the upsold item to the original order made by the customer and save shipping costs, you can always choose to open a new order, particularly if you dropship your products from separate suppliers.

Easy and Fast Upsell Checkout 

Infinitycrowd’ Features:
Infinitycrowd offers you several advanced features:

Fast offers builder: You don’t have to worry about a thing - your offer is a few clicks away! We pull all the information from your product pages and produce conversion upsell pages and special offer coupons with the click of a button.  
High Conversion Funnel: Once a customer purchases an item they will get a one-hour limited time offer that they will be able to choose from. The combination of urgency, a personal discount on items that will interest the buyer, a design that encourages engagement, and a customer who is already in a buying mode will produce a high conversion rate funnel and increase in sales. 
Fully Integrated PayPal Checkout: Infinitycrowd’ system works without you having to worry about enabling PayPal Reference transactions.
Multiple Offers: After their initial buy, each customer is presented with 5-10 coupons to choose from. The amount of offers increases the chance of making an upsell and gives a fast statistical indication of the attractiveness and relevance of the offer you’ve decided to set up. 
Offers are represented to customers in the confirmation email: To increase the likelihood of your customers upselling, Infinitycrowd automatically synchronizes with your WooCommerce’s confirmation email and sends your offers in the order confirmation email in addition to the thank you page.
Direct Access to Your Upsell Reports and Statistics: We give you direct access to our reports so that you can know exactly how much money you made using infinitycrowd as well as how well each upsell you made performed. By reviewing your reports, you’ll be able to add or edit current offers and increase your sales.
Option to Customize Your Upsell Rules: Even though our AI tool knows which offers will suit each customer the best, you can always manually set up rules to trigger the recipient of each offer based on the products he or she did or didn’t purchase.
